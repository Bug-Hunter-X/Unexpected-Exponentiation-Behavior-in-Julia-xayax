# Julia Code Bug: Potential Confusion with Exponentiation

This repository demonstrates a potential source of confusion in Julia code related to the exponentiation operator.  The issue arises from the use of `^` for exponentiation, which might not be immediately obvious to programmers accustomed to other languages where `^` has a different meaning (e.g., bitwise XOR).

## Bug Description

The Julia code uses `^` for exponentiation, this works correctly within Julia, but this operator is also used as the bitwise XOR operator in many other programming languages. This difference can lead to unexpected results for users coming from those other languages who may interpret `^` differently.

## Solution

The solution clarifies the correct use of the exponentiation operator in Julia and provides an alternative method for those unfamiliar with Julia's syntax.

## How to Run the Code

1. Save the code in a file named `bug.jl` and `bugSolution.jl`.
2. Open a Julia REPL.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the files using `cd`.
4. Run the code using `include("bug.jl")` and `include("bugSolution.jl")`.
